		<p>After completing an Art foundation year, I spent a further two years at Cornwall College of Art and Design where I gained a DATEC Higher Diploma in Ceramics.</p>
		<p>In 1986 I moved to Germany where I pursued my love of watercolours. I exhibited paintings in Germany and Belgium, which were mainly studies of flowers and wildlife. I returned to the UK and eventually settled in the Vale of Glamorgan in 1992, just a short walk from the beautiful scenery of the Welsh coast. </p>
		<p>An interest in exploring new mediums led to further studies but it was my introduction to fused glass which captivated me. It seemed a natural progression from my roots in ceramics and I was immediately hooked. Inspired by the colours and reflective qualities of the glass, it is always an exciting moment to see what comes out of the kiln. I use premium materials which enable me to create unique pieces with an extraordinary play of light.</p>
		<p>If something catches your eye and you would like more information, please contact me to discuss. I will also make bespoke pieces in colours to suit your d√©cor if preferred.</p>

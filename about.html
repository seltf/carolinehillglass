		<p>After completing an Art foundation year at Filton College, Bristol, I spent a further two years at Cornwall College of Art and Design where I gained a Higher DATEC Diploma in Ceramics.</p>
		<p>In 1986 I moved to Germany for 3 years where I pursued my love of watercolours. I exhibited paintings in Germany and Belgium, which were mainly studies of flowers and wildlife. I returned to the UK and settled in the Vale of Glamorgan in 1992, just a short walk from the beautiful scenery of the Welsh coast.</p>
		<p>An interest in exploring new mediums led to further studies in precious metal clay, upcycled jewellery and stained glass, but it was my introduction to fused glass which captivated me. It seemed a natural progression from my roots in ceramics and I was immediately hooked. Inspired by the colours and reflective qualities of the glass, it is always an exciting moment to see what comes out of the kiln.</p>
		<p>Each piece that I create is handmade and therefore totally unique. I use premium materials which enable me to create individual pieces with an extraordinary play of light which is often difficult to capture in a photograph.</p>
		<p>My pendants are usually set on silver plated nickel free bales, (though pieces set with sterling silver bales can be made to order at a small extra cost), and include an adjustable waxed cotton cord. Each piece will arrive presented in a gift box or organza pouch with a card confirming that your unique piece is handmade on the Welsh coast. </p>
